- **Java 17 or later:** Required to run the game. You can download it from <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">here</a>.
- **Apache Maven (_if using the command line_):** If you're running the game from a terminal, install Maven from <a href="https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi">maven.apache.org.</a>


- **Using IntelliJ IDEA?** No need to install Maven separately—it comes bundled with IntelliJ. Just open the **_pom.xml_** file as a project.

### Installation

_Follow these simple steps to get the project up and running on your machine._

#### For Command Line Users:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/CodecoolGlobal/dungeon-crawl-java-faboknorbert.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder
   ```sh
   cd dungeon-crawl-java-faboknorbert
   ```
3. Compile the Project (_this installs dependencies and compiles the code_)
   ```sh
   mvn compile
   ```
4. Run the application to play the game!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Once you have the game running, you can explore different dungeons, battle monsters, collect loot, and level up your character! Here’s how you play:

1. **Instructions**: 

- A — attack enemy
- O — open chest
- H — use healing potion (_restore max health_)
- P — use power potion (_add +3 strength for the next 3 attack_)
- I — talk to NPCs

2. **Explore Dungeons**: Move your character through the maps by using the keyboard. Explore dungeons and uncover treasures as you progress.


3. **Fight Monsters**: As you approach a monster, you’ll have the option to attack it. The outcome of the battle depends on your character's and the monster's stats (like health, attack, and defense).


4. **Monster Abilities**: Monsters you encounter may have special abilities such as poisoning you, attacking immediately, teleporting, or splitting into multiple enemies. Be strategic and make sure to manage your resources wisely to handle these surprises.


5. **Loot and Upgrade**: After defeating monsters, you may find loot such as gold, weapons, armor or healing potions. Use these items to improve your character’s stats and prepare for tougher battles ahead.


6. **Level Up**: As you defeat monsters and complete quests, you’ll gain experience points (XP). Leveling up increases your character’s stats, making them stronger and more capable of handling difficult enemies and dungeons.


7. **Complete Quests**: Along your journey, you’ll meet NPCs who might give you quests and sell you items. Take on quests to earn rewards and progress through the game!


8. **Defeat Bosses**: Within the game, you’ll encounter powerful bosses with unique abilities. These are some of the toughest challenges in the game, so use your upgraded equipment, stats, and careful strategy to take them down!

### Example: Monsters movement

Here’s a simplified snippet of how the monsters are moving on the map:

```java
public void move(int dx, int dy) {
   Cell nextCell = cell.getNeighbor(dx, dy);

   if (nextCell.isWalkable() && !isDead) {
      cell.setActor(null);
      nextCell.setActor(this);
      cell = nextCell;
   }
}
```
